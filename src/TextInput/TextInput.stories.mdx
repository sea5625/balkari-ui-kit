## Formatting

---

---

### Default Input

Where possible, add programmatic assistance. Detect and pre-fill inputs to reduce errors and save time. When the software canâ€™t determine the value that belongs in an input, use type-ahead to make suggestions. Use sentence-case for default values, detected values, and auto-completion text.

<TextInput />

### Validation

Real time validation helps to streamline the process and keep data clean when the user is filling out forms

<TextInput
    value="passwordpassword"
    type="password"
    passwordVisibleButton
    passwordVisibleButton
    invalid
    invalidValue="Your Password must be more then 8 characters long"
/>

---

---

---

---

---

## Content

---

### Placeholder Text

Placeholder text provides hints or examples of what to enter. Placeholder text disappears after the user begins entering data into the input and should not contain crucial information. Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as a direct statement without punctuation.

---

<TextInput placeHolder="Place Holder Text..." />

---

---

### Labels

Effective form labeling helps users understand what information to enter into a text input. Using placeholder text in lieu of a label is sometimes employed as a space-saving method.

---

<TextInput
    placeHolder="Place Holder Text..."
    label
    labelValue="TextInput label"
/>

---

---

### Helper Text

Helper text is pertinent information that assists the user in completing a field. Helper text is always available when the input is focused and appears underneath the label. Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as full sentences with punctuation.

---

<TextInput
    placeHolder="Place Holder Text..."
    label
    labelValue="TextInput label text"
    helper
    helperValue="TextInput helper text"
/>

---

---

---

---

---

## Extra

---

### Toggle Password Visibility

Toggle password visibility helps you experience the user experience of an input that takes over the password value with the passwordvisiblebutton attribute during TextInput's props.

<TogglePasswordVisibility />

---

---

### With Button Input
